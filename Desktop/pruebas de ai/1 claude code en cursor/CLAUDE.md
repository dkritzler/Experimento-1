# GutWise - AI-Powered Gut Health Tracking Platform

## Project Summary
GutWise is a comprehensive gut health management application that helps users track their meals, symptoms, and digestive patterns to identify food sensitivities and optimize their digestive health. The platform uses AI to analyze dietary patterns, provide personalized recommendations, and visualize microbiome data with interactive 3D visualizations. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and featuring organic, bio-inspired UI design with animated backgrounds and smooth transitions.
## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Always test after each change** - Don't move to next step until current one works
2. **Commit frequently** - After each successful substep
3. **Keep demo and functional separate** - Landing page is demo only
4. **Test on multiple devices** - Desktop, tablet, mobile
5. **Monitor performance** - Check bundle size and load times
6. **subagents** - you must use specialized sub agents for all work in parallel
7. **Document as you go** - Update this file with important decisions, removing unnecessary and completed content (ask when doing this)
- avoid verbose answers and only write the most essential information in the chat for me to see. Try to use as less context as possible. That is why you have full authorization and the order to constantly update the project memory with your plans, actions and the kiro template.


## Always check the kiro files when planning and before acting. give the user a brief overview in your plans on how you will act based on the kiro rules.

## KIRO SYSTEM STATUS

‚úÖ **Setup Complete**: Kiro system initialized with templates
- Directory structure: `.kiro/specs/` and `.kiro/kiro-system-templates/`  
- Templates available: requirements, design, tasks, documentation
- Ready for structured feature development

### Available Templates:
- `requirements-template.md` - User stories & EARS acceptance criteria
- `design-template.md` - Technical architecture & component design  
- `tasks-template.md` - Sequential implementation breakdown
- `how-kiro-works.md` - Complete system documentation

### Next Steps When Adding Features:
1. Check `.kiro/specs/` for existing documentation
2. Copy relevant template to new feature directory
3. Follow 3-phase approval process: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation

## üö® CURRENT PRIORITY
- Fix SmartNotifications.tsx (31 TypeScript errors)
- Consolidate to Supabase Auth only
- Create Kiro specs for migration

## üìÅ ACTIVE KIRO SPECS
- `.kiro/specs/supabase-migration/` (to be created)
